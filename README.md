# Employee Time Control System

This project is designed to manage employee work time, including break periods, clock-in/clock-out times, and work schedules. The system tracks when an employee logs in, when they take breaks, and when they log out, helping companies manage work hours efficiently. It integrates with multiple interfaces (API and Web) to collect and display data for employees and management.
